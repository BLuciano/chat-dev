CHAT DEV
=======

chatting system using AngularJS and firebase ( https://www.firebase.com/ )for storage and user authentication.

This project was aimed at learning and getting started with AngularJS. I also wanted to challenge myself and start getting a feeling for the backend so I thought a chat application would be a good start. I knew I was going to need a database and while researching I found out about Firebase. I chose Firebase because it took care of the backend all of the while letting me explore how things work. 
During the process of building this app I was watching/reading various tutorials on Angular. As I progressed and became more familiar with the framework I saw some opportunities for refactoring; some of which included using services and others using the built-in Angular methods.
